# Frontend Recipe (ExtJS)
Frontend Recipe demonstrates how to develop a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Sencha's tools. This project showcases a recipe management tool where recipes are associated with ingredients using a recipe ID. As of today, no security measures have been implemented. You are free to implement the backend in whatever you prefer. For an example using MSSQL + ASP.Net look at: https://github.com/malkhabir/webapi_recipe/tree/master

The "root" folder primarily serves as a container for top-level components of the application. While you can remove files and folders not used by the application, please review the following before deciding what to delete and what to keep in source control.

The following files are essential for building and loading the application:

- `"app.json"`: The application descriptor controlling the build and loading process.
- `"app.js"`: The file responsible for launching the application, primarily used to initiate an instance of the `MyApp.Application` class.
- `"index.html"`: The default web page for this application, which can be customized in `"app.json"`.
- `"build.xml"`: The entry point for Sencha Cmd to access the generated build script. This file provides hooks for process customization. Refer to the comments within for more information.

These files can be excluded from source control since they are generated by the build process:

- `"build"`: This folder contains the build output, including the generated CSS file, consolidated resources, and concatenated JavaScript file.
- `"bootstrap.*"`: These files are generated by the build and watch commands to enable the application to load in "development mode."

## Basic Application Structure

Applications targeting a single toolkit typically have the following structure:

app/ # Contains JavaScript and Theme code
model/ # Data model classes
view/ # Views, ViewModels, and ViewControllers
store/ # Data stores
controller/ # Global/application-level controllers

overrides/ # JavaScript code that is automatically required

resources/ # Assets such as images, fonts, etc.


### app/

This folder contains JavaScript (.js files) and styling (.scss files) common for all builds of the application.

#### app/controller/

This folder houses the application's global controllers. ViewControllers are located alongside their respective view classes in `"./view"`. These controllers handle routing and other tasks that span all views.

#### app/model/

The "app/model/" folder contains the application's (data) Model classes. To illustrate the basic structure of a model, let's take a look at the Recipe Model. The Recipe model represents a recipe entity in our application. It defines various fields that correspond to the attributes of a recipe, such as title, description, preparation time, author, type, and so on. Additionally, it specifies associations with other models and sets up a proxy for data communication with the server.

- **Fields**: The fields property defines the data fields present in the Recipe model. Each field is an object with properties like name and type, including a description of the fields.

- **Associations**: The Recipe model has a one-to-many association with the CountryTags model, which means that a recipe can be associated with multiple country tags.

- **Proxy**: The proxy property specifies how the Recipe model communicates with the server to perform CRUD operations. It uses an AJAX proxy to interact with the server through JSON data.

#### app/view/

This folder contains views, ViewModels, and ViewControllers based on the application's architecture. The directory structure is recommended for applications using MVCVM or MVC with ViewControllers.

app/view/
foo/ # Grouping of one or more views
Foo.js # The view class
Foo.scss # The view class styling
FooController.js # The controller for Foo (a ViewController)
FooModel.js # The ViewModel for Foo


To understand how a view is used, let's take a look at the RecipeGrid View. The RecipeGrid View is a panel with columns and docked items designed to display and manage recipe data, allowing users to view, add, edit, and delete recipes.

This grid contains columns with headers and a top-docked toolbar with buttons for adding, editing, and deleting recipes.

#### app/store/

The "app/store/" folder contains various store instances or types that can be reused in the application.

## Overrides

The contents of "overrides" folders are automatically required and included in builds. These overrides should not be explicitly mentioned in "requires" or "uses" in your code. This area is intended for applying patches or extensions to other classes.
